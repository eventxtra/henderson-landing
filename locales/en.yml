  des_title1: A Light Among Us — Memorial Exhibition of Dr. Lee Shau Kee
  des_content1: Dr. Lee Shau Kee was not only a legendary figure in Hong Kong's real estate industry, but also a beloved boss at his company, a loving father and grandfather at home. He was affectionately known as "Brother Four" among friends and "Uncle Four" to the citizens of Hong Kong. 
  des_title2: The Meaning of "A Light Among Us"
  des_content2: Laozi explained the concept of "Dao" as "harmonizing with light and blending with dust" —meaning that "Dao" is like light, illuminating everything in the world. This philosophy reflected Dr. Lee's approach to life — with ease and without vanity. He often used his abilities to help others, treating everyone equally and spreading warmth to all.
